# Java Build Directory README

## Overview

This directory contains multiple Java builds for various projects or modules. Each build is organized into its own
subdirectory and includes all necessary files for compilation, execution, and packaging.

## Directory Structure

The directory is structured as follows:

```
/java_builds
    /project1
        /src
        /lib
        /bin
        /docs
        build.gradle
        README.md
    /project2
        /src
        /lib
        /bin
        /docs
        pom.xml
        README.md
    ...
```

### Explanation of Subdirectories and Files

- **src/**: Contains the source code for the project.
- **lib/**: Contains external libraries and dependencies required by the project.
- **bin/**: Contains the compiled class files and executable binaries.
- **docs/**: Contains documentation related to the project, including API docs, user manuals, and guides.
- **build.gradle**: The Gradle build script for the project (if using Gradle).
- **pom.xml**: The Maven project descriptor file (if using Maven).
- **README.md**: Project-specific README file containing details about the project, how to build and run it, and other
  relevant information.

## Getting Started

To get started with any of the projects, navigate to the project's directory and follow the instructions in the project'
s README.md file. Below are general steps applicable to most projects.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools installed on your system:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or higher
- Gradle (for projects using Gradle)
- Maven (for projects using Maven)

### Building a Project

#### Using Gradle

1. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```sh
    cd /path/to/build-directory/project1
    ```

2. Execute the Gradle build command:

    ```sh
    gradle build
    ```

   This will compile the source code, run tests, and package the project.

#### Using Maven

1. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```sh
    cd /path/to/build-directory/project2
    ```

2. Execute the Maven build command:

    ```sh
    mvn clean install
    ```

   This will compile the source code, run tests, and package the project.

### Running a Project

After building the project, the compiled binaries can be found in the `bin/` directory. To run a project:

1. Navigate to the `bin/` directory:

    ```sh
    cd /path/to/build-directory/project1/bin
    ```

2. Execute the main class. For example:

    ```sh
    java com.example.Main
    ```
