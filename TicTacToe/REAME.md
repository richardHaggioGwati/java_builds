## Features

- Play TicTacToe against a computer.
- Randomized computer moves.
- Simple console-based UI.
- Immediate feedback on invalid moves and game results.

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.
- Basic understanding of how to run Java programs from the command line.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/richardHaggioGwati/java_builds/tree/main/TicTacToe
    cd TicTacToe
    ```

2. **Compile the Java Code:**
    ```sh
    javac TicTacToe.java
    ```

3. **Run the Game:**
    ```sh
    java TicTacToe
    ```

## Gameplay Instructions

1. The game board is represented as a 3x3 grid, with positions numbered 1 through 9:
    ```
     1 | 2 | 3
    ---+---+---
     4 | 5 | 6
    ---+---+---
     7 | 8 | 9
    ```

2. You will be prompted to enter a value between 1 and 9 to place your mark (X).

3. The computer will then randomly select a position to place its mark (O).

4. The game will continue until there is a winner or the board is full.

5. The game will display the result: player wins, computer wins, or a draw (CAT).

## Code Overview

### Main Class: TicTacToe

- **Variables:**
    - `playerPositions`: Stores the positions chosen by the player.
    - `computerPositions`: Stores the positions chosen by the computer.

- **Methods:**
    - `main(String[] args)`: The entry point of the game. It initializes the game board and handles the game loop.
    - `printBoard(char[][] gameBoard)`: Prints the current state of the game board.
    - `placePiece(char[][] gameBoard, int position, String user)`: Places the player's or computer's mark on the board
      based on the position.
    - `checkWinner(char[][] gameBoard)`: Checks for a winning condition or a draw and returns the result.

### Game Logic

1. **Game Board Initialization:**
    - The game board is a 2D character array representing the 3x3 grid.

2. **Player Move:**
    - The player is prompted to enter a position (1-9).
    - The game ensures the position is not already taken.

3. **Computer Move:**
    - The computer randomly selects a position (1-9).
    - The game ensures the position is not already taken.

4. **Winner Check:**
    - The game checks for winning conditions after each move.
    - If a winning condition is met, the game declares the winner and prints the final board state.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement a more sophisticated AI for the computer using the Minimax algorithm.
- Add a graphical user interface (GUI) for a better user experience.
- Allow players to choose their symbol (X or O).
- Add functionality for two-player mode.
